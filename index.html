<p> Henlo, ayang! ‡∏Ö ï Íàç·¥•Íàç î‡∏Ö Selamat tanggal 8 yang ke-2 bersama bocilmu ini, Kia! Happy nda selama 2 bulan ini, um? ‚ô° </p>
  <p>I‚Äôm glad to have you in this lifetime. Tied and destined to a soul like yours; I‚Äôm glad, glad, glad that it is you.</p>
  <p> Thankchuu for coming into my life. Thankchuu for making me smile like crazy. Thankchuu for making me happy.</p>
    <p> Thankchuu for showing me patience. Thankchuu for looking into my tired eyes and offering me a place to rest. Thankchuu for keeping me warm and holding me when things get too heavy.</p>
  <p>You were always there with me as my cheerleader, cheering for me in every phase of life. Thankchuu for everything you did for me, thankchuu for loving me.</p>
  <p>You have been my home since the moment I met you. I may not have realized it at first, but looking back now I know that it has always been you. You are a place that I want to stay forever, you are my home.</p>
  <p>And I‚Äôll always love you in the only way I know how; with my whole heart „Ö° with everything inside me.</p>
  <p>Thankchuu for making every day more special. I hope there will be even more happiness for us in the future.</p>
  <p>I love you, for all that you are, all that you have been, and all you‚Äôre yet to be.</p>
